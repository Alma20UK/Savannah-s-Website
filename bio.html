        British Director, Savannah Setten, offers unnerving and intimate visions in to individual worlds.  Nominated for Best New Director by SHOTS in her first year of Directing, Savannahs work has continued to deviate away from the expected and instead lives in the unfamiliar; cultivating her unique lens on the FELT human experience through her collaborations with an all male cast of inmates in a high security prison in Ukraine, the native Udege community living in the borderlands of Russia Korea and China, to her most recent collaborations with legacy artist Nas and his community in Queens New York whilst penning thought provoking commercial concepts for Kendrick Lamar and Dave Free founded company pgLang. Savannahs work has been nominated for Best Video at SXSW Film Festival in Texas & Cannes Young Director Awards and a selection of awards at UK Music Video Awards, SHOTS, 1.4 and Clio awards; you can find her work displayed on the likes of Vogue, iD, Nowness, Rolling Stone and Complex.
